## Symbolic Learning and KG Embeddings with Link Prediction and Community Detection




### Symbolic Learning
Follow the instructions to execute symbolic learning to generate enriched, and Tranformed KG.

```json
{
  "KG": "OriginalKG",
  "prefix": "http://example.org/lungCancer/entity/",
  "rules_file": "LungCancer-rules-short.csv",
  "rdf_file": "LungCancer.nt",
  "constraints_folder": "Constraints"
}
```

```python
python symbolic_predictions.py
```
